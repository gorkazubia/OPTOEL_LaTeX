Although the state-of-the-art linear displacement sensors have sub-nanometric measurement resolution, it is not easy to suppress the increase of measurement uncertainty when being applied for multi-axis angle and displacement measurement due to the Abbe errors and the influences of sensor misalignment. In this review article, the state-of-the-art multi-axis optical sensors, such as the three-axis autocollimator, the three-axis planar encoder, and the six-degree-of-freedom planar encoder based on a planar scale grating are introduced. With the employment of grating reflectors, measurement of multi-axis translational and angular displacement can be carried out while employing a single laser beam. Fabrication methods of a large-area planar scale grating based on a single-point diamond cutting with the fast tool servo technique and the interference lithography are also presented, followed by the description of the evaluation method of the large-area planar scale grating based on the Fizeau interferometer.},

The influence of the distance between the end face of the emitting fiber and the reflecting surface, the tilt angle of receiving optical fiber and the surface reflectivity on the performance of the sensor was analyzed. The optimal geometric parameters of the sensor structure were obtained based on the simulation results and the response of the sensor to different angular displacement was investigated. The experimental results show the sensor has large linear range for micro angular displacement detection and the sensitivity can reach to 0.0377 V/° and 0.08104 V/° for positive and negative angle detection respectively.},
